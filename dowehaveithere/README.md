# About this project

This app is being created to help in my daily life by tracking pantry inventory, associating inventory to categories and meals, and shopping list creation and priorization.

The goal is to implement a full CRUD single page app called dowehaveit? and deploy to Heroku.

This application utilizes React with class components, react-router-dom, and reactstrap.

## Components

Serveral components have been created and styled. The data displayed is hardcoded, as fetches to the database are continuing to fail.
The main components include: authentication, home, items, meals, and static content.

### Routing

The intent of this application is to be a single page application with authentication. React-router-dom is being utilized for component routing. As with other areas of functionality, routing is not functioning as intended.

#### Heroku

This application was successfully deployed to Heroku. However, after many changes, loops, turns, practically everything under to sun, final deployment has failed.

##### Final note - Work in progress!!!

The outcome of this project is not what was envisioned. Although saddened by this fact, I am encouraged for the future.  
So many questions have yet to be answered.
So much knowledge has yet to be acquired
So much understanding has yet to occur.
So many mountains have yet to be conquered.

Notice the 'yet'...not yeet...
I will continue to learn, acquire knowledge, gain understanding, conquer mountains, and improve my skills using this application as a vessel in my journey. This is not the end of the journey, merely the beginning!!!
